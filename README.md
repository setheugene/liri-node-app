LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

LIRI will search Spotify for songs, Bands in Town for concerts, and OMDB for movies.

Your input should look like the following to complete searches:

search spotify: spotify-this-song song name here
  -will provide artist, song name, album name, and a link to the preview

search bands in town: concert-this band name here
  -will provide upcoming concerts, venues, and dates for band

search omdb: movie-this name of movie here
  -will provide year movie was made, rating, rotten tomatoes rating, country, languages, plot, and actors
   
The app also saves previous searches in a random.txt file.

Images of the app functioning can be found in the 'images' folder
